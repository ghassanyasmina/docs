Yasmina provides ready-to-use HTML Snippets built with Bootstrap 5 (more will be added) to help you quickly add insurance products to your website.

These snippets are designed to accelerate your front-end development process by giving you a fully responsive and styled UI out of the box.

We currently have it available for Motor Insurance.

### What Are HTML Snippets?

The HTML Snippets are pre-built components that you can copy and paste into your site.

### How to add it?

Simply add the following code to your website. Do some tweaks to make it match your website's look & feel.

```html
<div class="card w-100">
	<script src="https://staging.yasmina.ai/js/toggle.js"></script>
	<!-- Bootstrap 5 JS Bundle -->
	<div class="card-header">
		Add Insurance by
		<img class="ms-2" src="https://www.tawuniya.com/assets/tawuniya-logo-BFmobvJd.svg"/>
	</div>
	<div class="card-body align-items-center">
		<div class="d-flex justify-content-between">
			<!-- Toggle Switch -->
