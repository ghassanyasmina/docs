### What is the IFrame?

The IFrame is a plug & play widget that handles all the heavy UI lifting. It enables your clients to browse, compare, and request SME Medical insurance without leaving your platform.

### Prerequisites

Before you embed the IFrame, make sure:

- You have an active Yasmina business account
- Your companyâ€™s employees have been added (via API)
- You have access to the `client_id` provided by Yasmina
- You are embedding the IFrame on an allowed domain (Can be set from <a href="https://portal.yasmina.ai">Portal</a>)

### How to embed it?

- Simply put the following code to your website

```html
<iframe
		src="https://staging.yasmina.ai/request-sme-policy"
		style="max-width: 1300px; width: 100%"
		height="800"
		title="Bootstrap Insurance Demo"
		sandbox="allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-modals allow-popups"
></iframe>
```




### What Does the IFrame Do?

- Displays a fully interactive SME Medical insurance price form
