        "new_owner_id": "2528297837",
        "previous_owner_id": "7001364939",
        "car_sequence_number": 723787810
    },
    "provider_policy_id": null,
    "provider_policy": null,
    "created_at": "2025-10-06T23:31:17.000000Z",
    "status": 0,
    "payment_link": "http://localhost:8000/short/wVln4",
    "price": 6016
}
```

This is a summary of the fields returned in the policy object

| Field               | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`   | Yasmina’s unique identifier for the policy.  |
| `meta_data` | A JSON object that contains information about the fields that were used to generate this policy. `extra_data` will also be returned here.   |
| `provider_policy_id`     | The policy ID that is returned by the policy provider.       |

| `price` | The price of the policy in Saudi Riyal |

### Understanding Payment and Policy activation

When you first make a request to the Issue Policy API. The Policy is not yet activated and the `status` is `0` (which means pending).

Also the `provider_policy` and `provider_policy_id` will both be `null`.

In order for the policy to be activated, the customer needs to make the purchase from the payment link. Once the customer successfully pays. The policy will be activated and the `status` becomes `1`.

<Note>Although the payment page is provided by Yasmina, it does not display the Yasmina logo or have any mention of Yasmina. <br /><br />Yasmina does not receive credit card information, instead the payment page sends card information directly to the payment vendor.</Note>

<Tip>On Sandbox, you can use a testing card with the following information: <br /> Card number: 4111 1111 1111 1111 <br /> Expiry: 02/27 <br /> CVV: 123 <br />Card owner: Yasmina test</Tip>

#### Showing a policy

In order to get a status of a policy, you can use the <a href="/car-api-reference/policies/show-policy" target="_blank">Show Policy API</a>. This API, takes a Yasmina Policy `id` and will return the policy object
This API is ideal when you want to re-fetch a specific policy after the PDF gets generated.
