Our APIs follow RESTful standards and are designed with consistent request and response structures, making them easy to integrate, test, and maintain within your systems.

## Travel Insurance Overview

Travel insurance is designed to cover individuals or groups during international trips. Yasmina currently supports **Schengen-compliant travel insurance**, with configurable trip duration and multi-traveller support.

A typical travel insurance flow includes:
1. Collecting trip and traveller information
2. Requesting a quote
3. Issuing the policy
4. Completing payment
5. Downloading policy documents

## Request Quote

In this step, your customer provides information about the trip and you present them with the price of the insurance.
In order to request a quote, you need to execute the following <a href="/yasmina-schengen-travel-insurance/quotes/request-quote" target="_blank">Request Quote API</a>.

### Endpoint
`POST /api/v1/travel/quotes`

### Example request
```json
{
  "nationality_id": "1234567890",
  "phone_number": "+966501234567",
  "email": "someone@example.com",
  "multi_entry": false,
  "duration": 10,
  "start_date": "2026-02-27",
  "date_of_birth": "1988-04-20",
  "travellers": [
    {
      "nationality": "SA",
      "full_name": "Yasmina Alex",
      "passport_number": "G12345678",
      "gender": "m",

      "relation": "self",
      "passport_expiry_date": "2026-10-30"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Purchase the Travel Policy

Before your customers can get the Travel Insurance Policy, they will need to complete the payment. The <a href="/yasmina-schengen-travel-insurance/policies">Purchase Policy API</a> is used to get a policy object with a payment link.

You will need to provide the `quote_id` obtained from the previous step.

Afterwards you get a response that has a policy object, and in that response there is a `payment_link`.

Redirect the customer to this link to complete the payment process.

### Endpoint
`POST /api/v1/yasmina-schengen-travel`

### Example request
```json
{
  "quote_id": "Q-FNWXGDPK",
}
```

### Example response
```json
{
    "id": 936,
    "meta_data": {

                    "price": 55,
                    "total": 55
                }
            },

}
```

### Redirect URL

In addition to supplying the `quote_id` you can also add `redirect_url`. This is used to redirect the customer to any page or deep link you need after the payment is completed. You can also include a query string with policyID and it will automatically replace it with the actual `id` of the policy object.

Example for policy `id` 123

```
	{
		quote_id: "Q-FNWXGDPK",
		redirect_url: "https://www.example.com?yasmina_policy_id=policyID"
	}
```

Will become on the response

```
	{
		redirect_url: "https://www.example.com?yasmina_policy_id=123"
	}
```

And the customer that purchased the policy will be redirected to
https://www.example.com?yasmina_policy_id=123

### Showing & Downloading the policy

In order to get a status of a policy, you can use the <a href="/yasmina-schengen-travel-insurance/policies/show-policy" target="_blank">Show Policy API</a>. This API, takes a Yasmina Policy `id` and will return the policy object
The response includes both `policy_url` and `invoice_url`, these URLs contain pdf files that your customer can download.
