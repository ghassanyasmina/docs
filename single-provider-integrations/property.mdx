### Understanding Payment and Policy activation

When you first make a request to the Issue Policy API. The Policy is not yet activated and the `status` is `0` (which means pending).

Also the `provider_policy` and `provider_policy_id` will both be `null`.

In order for the policy to be activated, the customer needs to make the purchase from the payment link. Once the customer successfully pays. The policy will be activated and the `status` becomes `1`.

<Note>Although the payment page is provided by Yasmina, it does not display the Yasmina logo or have any mention of Yasmina. <br /><br />Yasmina does not receive credit card information, instead the payment page sends card information directly to the payment vendor.</Note>

<Tip>On Staging and Sandbox, you can use a testing card with the following information: <br /> Card number: 4111 1111 1111 1111 <br /> Expiry: 02/27 <br /> CVV: 123 <br />Card owner: Yasmina test</Tip>
