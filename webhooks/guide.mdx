Webhooks allow your system to receive real-time notifications from Yasmina whenever key events occur. This enables seamless integrations and automated workflows.

You can manage Webhooks from <a href="https://portal.yasmina.ai/api-management">API Management</a>

### Available Webhooks

| Event              | Description                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Status Update**  | Triggered when the status of a policy changes. |
| **Document Update**| Triggered when a document is uploaded to a policy.                 |

Each webhook can be configured with a callback **URL** where you will receive the event payloads.

### Webhook Security

To ensure the authenticity of incoming requests, Yasmina includes a **Webhook Key** in the header of every webhook request.

- **Header**: `x-webhook-key`
- **How to get it**: You can generate and manage your Webhook Key by clicking Edit and the refresh icon in the Webook key field

Make sure to validate this key in your endpoint handler to confirm that the request originated from Yasmina.

### Testing the webhook

Yasmina allows you to test your Webhook instantly. Simply Click on "Test call".

### Payload Structure

Webhook requests are sent as `POST` requests with a JSON body. The payload will be the same object that you acquire when you create a policy, for example:
