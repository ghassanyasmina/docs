Yasmina provides three separate environments to support your full development and integration lifecycle — from internal testing, to integration validation, to going live with real customers

***

### Production
This is the live environment where your customers purchase real insurance policies through your platform. All actions here have real-world impact and are subject to live processing and billing.

Use this environment only after your integration has been fully tested and approved.

***

### Sandbox
The Sandbox environment behaves just like Production — same APIs, same flows — but it uses dummy data. This makes it perfect for:

* Testing your API integration

* Simulating real-world scenarios

* Internal QA or demos

Although the flows mirror Production, no real policies are issued and no live data is processed.
