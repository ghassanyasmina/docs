We currently do not provide APIs integration to our Livestock insurance. However we do provide a responsive micro-site.

This micro-site is basically just a form that your customers can apply for insurance from. After they submit, an email is sent to you and us, and we will take it from there.

You can easily embed this on your own website or even Mobile App via Webview. We made sure it has no branding in order to be able to customize it for your business.

Just contact us <a href="https://www.yasmina.ai/contactus">here</a>, and we can provide it for you
