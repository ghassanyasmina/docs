### Authorization

To access any of our API's. You need to authorize yourself. We are using [OAuth 2.0 client credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/) to achieve that. <br />
You will need `client_key` and `client_secret`. You can get these from your [portal](https://portal.yasmina.ai/api-management).<br /><br />
Go to the following link to use the [Authorization API](https://www.google.com).
<Warning>For security reasons. Do not make your client_key and client_secret public in your platform.</Warning>

### Creating a Company record

After acquiring an access_token, you can begin using the APIs. The first step to produce policies is to create a company record with their employees. After creating the company record, you can request to issue policies to the employees of that company.

The [POST companies API](/medical-api-reference/company/create-company), will require few fields that define details of the company such as Email, Phone etc...

It will return a response with a unique identifier (id). Here is an example of the response from the POST companies API.
```
{
  "name": "Misk schools",
  "name_ar": "مدارس مسك",
  "sponsor_number": "123",
  "email_address": "masoud@yasmina.ai",
  "phone_number": "0797531543",
  "commercial_registration_number": "456",
  "client_id": "9c5b2b00-abcd-496c-a60b-8892fb63f0c3",
  "updated_at": "2024-07-15T20:36:12.000000Z",
  "created_at": "2024-07-15T20:36:12.000000Z",
  "id": 3
}
```
You can also visit the [List companies API](/medical-api-reference/company/list-companies) to show all companies you've created

### List available packages
Before you start issuing policies to a Company's employees. Check out the [Categories API](/medical-api-reference/products/list-categories).
This gives you a list of available insurance categories.
1. The Insurance provider PDF
	- Contains an overview picture of what is provided by the Insurance provider
2. The translations
	- The translations includes **keys** that map to the instructional text in Arabic and English that were provided by the insurance provider.
3. The categories
	- The categories items uses these keys and gives the coverage values

Coverage values can either be a number (the amount), or a boolean (whether it's covered or not), or a text (the type of coverage) Each item in the categories has a category property. This is what you will need to provide when you issue policies. Notice the category field in the following sample of the categories response API.

### Request insurance policies
To issue policies, you need to execute the [Request policies API](/medical-api-reference/policies/request-policies).
The API takes two fields. The company_id as referenced above. And an array called insured. The insured are the employees that the company wants to request insurance for.policies
Here is an example of a payload you would send
```
{
  "insured": [
    {
        "name": "Ghassan Barghouti",
        "nationality_iso": "JO",
        "category": "MG1",
        "iqama_id": "123",
        "date_of_birth": "1988-04-20",
        "number_of_dependents": 1
    },
    {
        "name": "Masoud El-Helou",
        "nationality_iso": "SA",
        "category": "MG1",
        "nationality_id": "123",
        "date_of_birth": "1988-04-20",
        "number_of_dependents": 1
    }
  ],
  "company_id": 1
}
```
Notice in the above, there are two employees within the company. One of them we are supplying the `iqama_id` as he is a Non-Saudi while the other we supply a `nationality_id` as he is Saudi.
The `category` that we are supplying is what was returned from the [Categories API](/medical-api-reference/products/list-categories)

### HR declaration forms
You can dispatch HR forms using the [Dispatch HR Forms API](/medical-api-reference/hr-forms/dispatch-hr-forms) for the employees that you are requesting insurance for. And then later supply them to the insurance provider

### Payment
Yasmina will supply a payment link of which your clients can pay for the insurance. You must share this link in your platform.
