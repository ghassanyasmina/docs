### Authorization

To access any of our API's. You need to authorize yourself. We are using [OAuth 2.0 client credentials](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/) to achieve that. <br />
You will need `client_id` and `client_secret`. You can get these from your [portal](https://portal.yasmina.ai/api-management).<br /><br />

After making the request, you will get access_token in the response. Example
```
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 31536000,
    "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiI5YmEyOTNmNy01ZjYyLTRlODItYmU5Yi1kODA0Y2M5ZDM5MmMiLCJqdGkiOiJlZWJjMWM5MWEyZThkMTVmNTYxNjZjMjkwM2Q0NTZjM2IzYWM5MTU5ZTdkODQ2YTE5NmFlYjcxMWM5OTJlMjc2MzAzNjY3MDA1MDQzM2U0OSIsImlhdCI6MTczNTkwNTE5OC40NTg5MiwibmJmIjoxNzM1OTA1MTk4LjQ1ODkyMSwiZXhwIjoxNzY3NDQxMTk4LjQ1Njk0LCJzdWIiOiIiLCJzY29wZXMiOltdfQ.Dy6df9fr4eBMLtkjnzcBjrXSg2AZLrmrBBC1NF8wmQaIOjcNffiqMiL9MqdMPj43Dxt4fj9rT1_S8dfwEpSbxNuIweNLOa7iDYpqMQ2l-cKG_sn24G27exZ9shLG8p2FHa4SHxSByRw00aCJceiTzq12LLNfc14rGPKZOv5Pi-HuLAP6ms_NfyN-KafOFOjYym4PyHCuTX8jEkoImgpBUpPgdnq1qyQdrZxL4grp0P_ezkhTgHgWwuzjSYgm4l-Eyga65kua-pdgWbhJ7-I1W_hjWT2dKCivcmk6nR9wtTjWs9hBvZrOfoZmox4YPIjZ_pvImZbHcZui-7xs80dnoaTKRviR8aot0cPIKoqRwinBodjWRh3QEu5juT1b7T-m85Wo_JNRoarKD4pW2Lzq7v1u9Z6PMEeYXvuFchzZ6HPvthblfwbtu3AX6ij0ZGlZPdMRdEiRtZf3dt8nsWdI-E_J0GAD-9wexlpNL92Z-IfuwMXuUQs_j4l92fcfBC_NxlEUTNACyOWPrA3V6ZSLHrga6W4Iz6Por3txzCsxlwvEBQAM70VyGeSqFi0wMLg2V8wVYAEpiEe2dl4RpMbUaPzRNc_KsDUYM_4DqwMTo2v2x4AAPxWmWiRn4PeAXovraN6Ll-eW9zq5hUbt3c-yj0spVYhJADHodoHmAdQM9MA"
