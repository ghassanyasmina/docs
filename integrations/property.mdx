## Introduction
This guide describes the Property Insurance APIs available on Yasmina’s platform. These APIs cover the core operations required for property insurance. This includes getting prices, issuing and managing policies, generating payment links, and handling claims.
Our APIs follow the RESTful standard and are structured to provide consistent inputs and outputs, making them straightforward to integrate, test, and maintain within your systems.

## What you will learn
- Getting prices for property insurance
