## Introduction
This guide describes the Property Insurance APIs available on Yasmina’s platform. These APIs cover the core operations required for property insurance. This includes getting prices, issuing and managing policies, generating payment links, and handling claims.
Our APIs follow the RESTful standard and are structured to provide consistent inputs and outputs, making them straightforward to integrate, test, and maintain within your systems.

## What you will learn
- Getting prices for property insurance
- Issuing policies
- Uploading images for your insured property
- Starting a claim

## Prerequisites
1. **Account in Yasmina** - See the <a href="/introduction#onboarding" target="_blank">Onboarding section</a> for details.  You need to add "Property (Multiple Providers)" in the products field.
2. **Authenticated Token** - You can follow the <a href="/authentication" target="_blank">Authentication guide</a> or head straight to the <a href="/auth-api-reference/oauth-20/generate-token" target="_blank">Generate Token API</a>.
3. **Backend server** - Required to securely call Yasmina APIs.

## Get prices
Yasmina works with multiple insurance providers. You can retrieve and compare prices using the <a href="/property-api-reference/prices/list-prices" target="_blank">List Prices API</a>. This helps your customers choose their most suitable option.

Currently, we are provide pricing from the following five providers:

- Walaa
- Medgulf
- Tawuniya
- Takaful Al-Rajhi
- Wataniya

## Address from Short Code

The <a href="/property-api-reference/addresses/get-full-address-from-short-address-code" target="_blank">GET Address Endpoint</a> allows you to retrieve the **full property address** by providing only a short address code (e.g., Saudi Post short code). It is especially useful when users enter or scan their short address, and you need to automatically fill in the property details in the form.

Example of a request
```
GET /api/v1/property/address-from-short?short_address=RRRC7866 HTTP/1.1
Host: portal.yasmina.ai
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accept: application/json
```

Example of a response
```
{
    "building_number": "7866",
    "zip_code": "13342",
    "additional_number": "2641",
    "street_name": "Ahmad Al Gazali",
    "district_name": "Al Arid Dist.",
    "city_name": "Riyadh"
}
```


<Note>Please note that the short address API does not provide *unit_number*. This needs to be supplied separately to the Issue Policy API</Note>

### Retrieving the policy object again

You can retrieve the policy objects that were created by you any time by either using the <a href="/property-api-reference/policies/list-policies" target="_blank">Listing policies API</a> or the <a href="/property-api-reference/policies/show-policy" target="_blank">Show policy API</a>

The Listing policy API can take some filters to retrieve only specific policies. This might be helpful if you have your own internal system and want to list policies by different values.
Example Request
```
GET /api/v1/property/policies?nationality_id=9881052027 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: ••••••
```

The Show Policy API will retrieves a specific policy object based on path ID
Example Request
```
GET /api/v1/property/policies/875 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: ••••••
```

### Cancellation Status

The <a href="" target="_blank">Cancellation Status API</a> provides real-time visibility into the cancellation state of a policy. Upon receiving a request, Yasmina initiates a query to the relevant insurance provider, fetches the current policy information, and returns a structured response reflecting the latest cancellation status. This ensures your system always displays accurate and timely policy data.

Example Request
```
GET /api/v1/property/policies/849/cancellation-status HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Authorization: ••••••
```

Example Response
```
{
    "status": "active"
}
```

### Payment and Policy activation

When you first make a request to the Issue Policy API. The Policy is not yet activated and the `status` is `0` (which means pending).

Also the `provider_policy` and `provider_policy_id` will both be `null`.

In order for the policy to be activated, the customer needs to make the purchase from the payment link. Once the customer successfully pays. The policy will be activated and the `status` becomes `1`.

<Note>Although the payment page is provided by Yasmina, it does not display the Yasmina logo or have any mention of Yasmina. <br /><br />Yasmina does not receive credit card information, instead the payment page sends card information directly to the payment vendor.</Note>

<Tip>On Staging and Sandbox, you can use a testing card with the following information: <br /> Card number: 4111 1111 1111 1111 <br /> Expiry: 02/27 <br /> CVV: 123 <br />Card owner: Yasmina test</Tip>

### Redirect URL

You can supply the payload a `redirect_url`. This is used to redirect the customer to any page or deep link you need. You can also include a query string with policyID and it will automatically replace it with the actual `id` of the policy object.

Example for policy `id` 123
```
	{
		...,
		redirect_url: "https://www.example.com?yasmina_policy_id=policyID"
	}
```
Will become on the response
```
	{
		redirect_url: "https://www.example.com?yasmina_policy_id=123"
	}
```
And the customer that purchased the policy will be redirected to
https://www.example.com?yasmina_policy_id=123

### Upload Images

Supporting documents are required from your clients. These can include home photos, images of valuable contents, or surrounding areas.

You can upload these documents using the <a href="/property-api-reference/policies/upload-documents" target="_blank">Upload Document API</a>
